Python Analysis Focus:
Geographical conflict exposure and education patterns in North-East Nigeria Statistical evidence of conflict's impact on educational outcomes.

Essay/Thesis Focus:
Displacement induced impacts on Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Case study of IDP educational challenges

The Bridge:
I'm using geographical conflict exposure as a methodological proxy for displacement effects, since in North-East Nigeria, conflict zones directly correspond to areas with high IDP concentrations. The Python analysis provides the empirical evidence, while the essay provides the conceptual framework interpreting these findings through a displacement lens.

This approach allows me to maintain methodological rigor in the data analysis while fully addressing the displacement-focused research questions in the written component.
